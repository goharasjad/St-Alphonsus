# St-Alphonsus
A PHP\HTML web application used for management of St Alphonsus primary school data.
The website features options for Pupil Management, such as enrolling a new pupil as well as deleting the students record. The application also provides validated update of pupil data, keeping the constraints of the problem in view.
Parents data is also managed and the relationship between the parents and pupil (No pupil can have more than 2 parents and Parents can enroll multiple children in the school). Similar CRUD opreations have also been provided for parent management.
Classes data is also stored and there are a total of 7 classes from Reception Year to Year Six, where each class can have atleast 40 students. The administration cannot add more classes unless there is a structural change in the school and they decide to change the classes information. Each class can also be taught by only 1 Teacher and no Teacher can teach 2 classes.

This concludes the basic inforamtion about the project.
